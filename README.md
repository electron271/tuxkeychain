# Tux Keychain
Keychain shaped like Tux, the Linux mascot. But it's not just a keychain, it runs embedded Linux!

Unfortunately this is more expensive than usual due to tariffs and inflation. (Probably cheaper in other countries.)

**This project is not made by the All Things Linux 501(c)(3) organization. This project is made by All Things Linux staff members.**

NOTE: This is still in the prototype stage, changes to the design are likely.

## Manufacturing
- This is a 4-layer PCB so it can fit in the Tux keychain form factor.
- Make sure you use ENIG for the PCB finish, else Tux will be gray instead of gold. (If you want a gray Tux, seek help.)
- This is designed for JLCPCBs assembly service, some parts are LCSC exclusive*.

*You can probably find them on other chinese distributors, but I don't know which ones.
